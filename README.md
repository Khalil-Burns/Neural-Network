# Neural-Network

Description
===========

Feed-forward neural network from scratch using Java. The purpose of project is to classify images as digits (numbers from 0 - 9) based on the way they look to the program using deep learning, with the help of the MNIST dataset (https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
Features include:
- support with 28x28 pixel handwritten digits
- backpropagation using gradient descent
- Matrix class
- 96% accuracy on 10,000 testing images (accuracy varies due to randomness at the beginning of training)
- Customizable network layers, learning rates, and number of training epochs

How to run
==========

Make sure you are in the /Neural-Network directory, then run:
`javac Main.java`
`java Main`
